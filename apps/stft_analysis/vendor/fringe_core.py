"""Cubic-phase fringe analysis — THE source of truth for the fit math.

This module is the ONE place the analysis lives. `plot_traces.py` imports it for the
standalone/harness path, and the App_Apps production port carries a VERBATIM COPY of this
file plus a thin adapter (`fringe_fit.py`). Nothing here may be hand-edited in only one of
those two places.

That rule exists because breaking it is what produced every bug found on 2026-07-16: the
port had drifted into passing Nelder-Mead's absolute `fatol` as L-BFGS-B's relative `ftol`
(envelope offset 255 against a truth of 155), into seeding the cubic with `c1=0` (carrier
wrong on every real trace), and into having no baseline anchor at all. Two hand-maintained
copies of the same math is the defect, not the symptom. `test/fringe_parity_test.py` in the
app asserts this file's `analyze()` and the app's adapter agree bit-for-bit, and it fails
loudly the moment the copies diverge.

Pure numpy/scipy: no matplotlib, no file I/O, no globals mutated at runtime. Safe to import
from a subprocess worker.

Pipeline (see analyze()):
  1. detect a spectrally clipped interferometer arm and drop the fringe-free band
  2. fit the envelopes under an asymmetric pinball loss, offset anchored to the continuum
  3. crop to the high-visibility core (contrast trim), normalize the fringes
  4. Hilbert -> two-trim seed: phase-value trim + polyfit, with a signed null-flip seed
     taken per |f| dip only on a clear SSE win, then BIC picks the phase order (see
     core_seed_fit)
  5. refit the cubic phase on the RAW counts with the envelopes held fixed
  6. propagate the fit covariance and decide WHERE (and whether) the phase can be trusted

# --- Baseline anchor for the envelope offset --------------------------------
# ZOOM is +-3.1 sigma around a sigma~3.9 bump, so it contains ZERO pure-baseline points.
# With no baseline in view the Gaussian's offset is unconstrained, and the tau=0.91
# quantile lowers its own loss by floating `off` UP and shrinking sigma with it -- on a
# high-visibility trace it settled at off=255 against a truth of 155, squeezing sigma ~12%
# narrow, which corrupts the truncation width and inflates rms_frac. So we measure the
# continuum from the FULL frame (outside the bump) and bound `off` to it.
#
# This is invisible on the saved .xls traces: they are low-visibility (bump ~25 counts over
# a ~145 baseline) and fit correctly at every window with either optimizer. The bug only
# bites bright/high-contrast live data. Do not trust those files to catch it.

# --- Wing truncation before the Hilbert transform ---
# Keep only the high-visibility core where the envelope contrast (upper-lower gap) is
# >= min + THRESHOLD*(max-min); higher => tighter crop. Swept on the harness (4 tuning
# seeds x seven values 0.10..0.45): pass rate rises MONOTONICALLY as we crop tighter up
# to a broad flat plateau at 0.35-0.45 (~98.6%, vs 97.7% at the old 0.25), i.e. the
# low-SNR fringe wings hurt the phase fit more than their extra lever-arm helps. 0.40 is
# the plateau centre; held out on 3 fresh seeds it stays ahead (99.0% vs 98.8%) and it
# leaves real-data cores healthy (~150-185 pts) with the da17 null unmoved (@799.53).

                        # to fail trust on 2020607181645 AND clipped clean cores enough that
                        # their faded blue-edge visibility read as a lead-in dead run, firing
                        # the knife on a clean trace. 0.30 keeps the arm; the knife now removes
                        # the dead sliver, so the contrast crop no longer has to.

# --- Truncated-arm detection (DIAGNOSTIC ONLY -- never feeds the fit) ---------
# One interferometer arm clipped (slit / aperture / shaper mask) removes a spectral
# tail of THAT arm. The fringes are the cross term 2*A_a*A_b*cos(Phi), so in the band
# where A_b = 0 the oscillation stops ABRUPTLY and only the un-clipped arm's smooth
# Gaussian tail survives (the DC also steps down by A_b^2, but at the real ~7%
# visibility that step is ~1.7 counts -- comparable to read noise, so we do NOT rely
# on it). We detect the fringe collapse: a run of samples where the measured local
# fringe peak-to-peak has died relative to the fitted envelope gap (U-L, which still
# predicts fringes there), running out to the edge of the detectable region.
#
# The confounder is a NULL: where the instantaneous frequency crosses zero the fringe
# is ALSO locally flat, over a half-width ~sqrt(pi/2|c2|) that can reach several nm.
# Two things separate a null from a clip, and we require BOTH:
#   (a) PINNING -- at a null the trace is parked on an envelope (|n| ~ 1); a clipped
#       band sits strictly INSIDE them (the lone arm's power A_a^2 lies between the
#       trough and crest levels), so |n| is well below 1.
#   (b) EDGE-TOUCHING -- a null is interior (fringes resume on both sides); a clipped
#       tail runs from its edge out to the boundary of the detectable region.
# Detection is deliberately confined to where fringes are detectable AT ALL: the
# envelope gap must beat the read noise by TRUNCDET_SNR_GAP, otherwise noise-only
# wings would read as "fringes missing" on every trace.

# The Hilbert instantaneous frequency is UNSIGNED (== |f|); a genuine null is a V
# in |f| that rises on BOTH sides of an interior minimum. We smooth |f|, find that
# minimum, and require the V to be prominent enough on each side. A monotonic (no
# in-window null) trace has |f| rising on one side only, so the two-sided

# --- Two-trim + null-flip seed core (replaces BIC/order selection) -------------
# The seed for the full-signal fit is chosen by the two-trim scheme, validated on the
# synthetic grid (endtrim_synth.py, 100%/216) and on the six real traces: the contrast
# crop above already removed the low-visibility wings (trim 1); here we take the Hilbert
# phase, drop the top/bottom PHASE_TRIM of its VALUE range (trim 2) to cut the folded
# null plateau, and polyfit a quadratic seed of the surviving one-sided arm. That seed
# is right whenever the phase is (near-)monotonic. Where the fringe frequency crosses a
# zero-path null the monotonic Hilbert phase FOLDS, so for each |f| dip we also build a

# past the clip only one arm survives, so with the envelopes mis-estimated across the
# collapsed gap n sits PINNED near +-1 (high |n|) while it no longer OSCILLATES. Measured
# on a real left-clip: the dead band reads rolling-|n| ~0.9 (higher than the live core)
# yet its local oscillation is ~0.05. So the end-trim keys on oscillation -- the rolling
# STD of n about its local mean -- not magnitude. A genuine null reads low oscillation too,
# but it is LOW-|n| (n passes through 0) and, decisively, INTERIOR (fringes resume past it),
# so trimming only edge-touching dead runs leaves it untouched. Threshold is a low floor: a
# dead band is ~0.05, a null bottom ~0.11, the weakest real fringe ~0.25, so 0.15 sits in
# the gap and only trims genuinely oscillation-free ends.

# on every harness -- it over-crops good traces into false-drops (even after the smoothing
# and one-sided-envelope fixes it added 16 false-drops vs no coarse cut on the realistic
# synth suite) and it never fixed the truncation corner it was built for. The scan-free path
# is: full-window envelopes -> contrast crop -> oscillation end-trim -> Hilbert -> TRUNCATION
# TRIM -> seed/fit. On the realistic suite this beats the shipped scan (99.6% vs 98.8%, fewer
# wrong) with no 12 s scan. Truncation is handled by trimming the core; two methods, both

# --- Phase-order selection (BIC, replaces ridge regularization) ---------------

# (q=1 carrier / q=2 chirp / q=3 +TOD). Instead of a hand-tuned ridge, BIC = n·ln(SSE/n)
# + k·ln(n) penalizes extra terms, so spurious TOD is rejected automatically -- no tuning
# knob. Applied only when the frequency is one-signed (no null); at a null TOD is
# unidentifiable and the order is capped at 2 (see core_seed_fit).

# --- Soft null penalty (on the |f| V-fit that provides the null-flip seed) -------
# The null seed fits the Hilbert |f| with a frequency polynomial whose value at the
# anchor is softly pulled to zero, so the seed genuinely has its null at the located
# minimum. Soft (a penalty, not a hard constraint) so real data still moves it.

# corner's pretty 0.938->0.996 is in that false-confidence bucket -- a mirage, not recovery.

# so envelope error becomes a large offset in n, which the Hilbert transform mixes into the
# phase. Implemented as n - gaussian_filter1d(n, sigma) with sigma from the mean
# zero-crossing period. Result on the seven real traces: SIX were bit-identical (the full
# fit dominates the seed, same finding as the flip-scan null experiment), and the seventh,
# da_15.95ga_-75, COLLAPSED -- r2_fringe 0.645 -> -0.116.
# Mechanism: that trace has a null, so its local period runs 4.2 samples in the blue third
# to 8.0 in the middle. ONE global kernel cannot be "about one period" everywhere -- at
# sigma=5.3 it was 0.8x the local period in the blue third, where it tracked the fringe and
# ate 14.7% of the fringe RMS, while removing only 1.4% in the middle where the baseline

# --- Adaptive phase reference ------------------------------------------------
# The phase is reported at a REFERENCE wavelength. The default is the intensity centroid
# muU (~802 nm): that is where the pulse energy is and what phase stabilization asks about.
# But a clip near the core leaves 802 sitting a nm or two from the edge of the surviving
# fringes, and the phase there stops being supported by data -- measured, a cut 1-2 nm from
# 802 drops reported accuracy to ~87-90% and makes the trust gate decline ~40% of fits it
# would otherwise have got right.
#
# So when the primary reference is untrustworthy we fall back to the CORE CENTROID l0 =
# mean(core), which is both the fit's own basis origin (d = 0, so no covariance is
# propagated and the answer is as well-conditioned as the data allow) and, for a one-sided
# clip, automatically the point furthest from the cut. The reference actually used is
# reported in R["ref_wl"], and R["ref_fallback"] says whether it moved.
#
# Switching reference is not free for the app -- a stabilization loop locked to one
# wavelength must not chatter between two -- so the app passes a ReferencePolicy that
# requires REF_HYST consecutive traces before switching EITHER way. The standalone and the
# harness pass no policy, which means switch immediately (per user: "for testing you can
# immediately do the fallback").

# reciprocal of that:

    loss exploits that by floating the offset up.

    The refinement is Nelder-Mead. This once used L-BFGS-B on the analytic subgradient,
    which really did stop at loss 7182.5 after 19 iterations (off=255.1, sigma=3.41) where
    NM reaches 5381.1 (off=164.9, sigma=3.73) -- but measured 2026-07-16, the cause was NOT
    that the pinball kink defeats a quasi-Newton method. It was a units bug: the caller
    passed Nelder-Mead's ABSOLUTE f-tolerance (FIT_FATOL=1e-4) as L-BFGS-B's `ftol`, which
    is a RELATIVE reduction criterion whose default is 2.22e-9 -- ~45000x looser, so it quit

    (off=164.2, loss 5381.0, 50 iters) and is NOT erratic on wide windows (sigma=3.87,
    matching NM, against the 5.31 once claimed). The analytic gradient is correct -- it
    agrees with central differences to 6 significant figures.

    So NM is kept not because L-BFGS-B is broken but because it is unconditionally safe on a
    kinked loss and costs nothing here (~3.3 -> ~15 ms per fit, against 28-80 ms fits and a
    100 ms exposure on an acquisition-limited pipeline). If that ever stops being free,

    TWO gates, because there are two consumers and they need different things.

    `ok_phase` covers c0 alone -- the unwrapped phase AT the reference. That is the entire
    quantity the stabilization loop consumes: it corrects phase at one wavelength, and the
    fitted carrier and chirp are only the vehicle for evaluating it there. This is what
    `trust_ok` means and what the app's accept gate must use.

    `ok_shape` covers c1..c3 -- the frequency and chirp. Nothing in the control loop reads
    these, but anything that evaluates the fit AWAY from the reference does: the chart
    overlay, and the fringe-frequency (GHz) readout, which extrapolates across the whole
    793-811 nm window where a wrong c2 shows up multiplied by d^2.

    Keeping them fused was over-rejecting frames whose phase was fine, and would also have
    let a phase-trustworthy fit quote a frequency range it could not support. Neither is
    what you want, and no single flag can express both.

    `nsig` overrides TRUST_NSIG for this call (the app surfaces it as a UI knob). It is a
    parameter rather than a mutated global so that two callers -- or two threads -- can
    never silently reconfigure each other.

    Propagating to the CENTRE is what catches the other truncation failure mode: if the
    clip removed the fringes around the spectral centre, reporting the phase there is
    extrapolation into a band with no interference -- physically unknowable. A small c3
    error blows up as 3*c3*d^2 (measured |dc1| ~ 0.3 at d = 4.5 nm), and the propagated

# ===================== TRUNCATION RECOVERY (cut scan) ========================
# The detector's job -- "find the clip, then cut there" -- turned out to be the hard way
# round. Every version of it had to measure something (contrast against a prediction, the
# residue against noise, the residue against its own peak, the abruptness of the edge) and
# each measurement was defeated by a different property of a real trace: the envelope is 2%
# off a Gaussian and bump/noise is 411 so that 2% is 8 sigma; k = h/bump is not constant in
# lambda (0.70 at f=1.2 cyc/nm -> 0.38 at f>3.5, the slit smearing fast chirped fringes);
# the local period estimate reads 0.63 against a true 1.56 because a fringe-free band has no
# crossings to count; and a clean trace's envelope RISE is steeper than a real clip's edge
# (measured slope 3.44 vs 1.83), so even abruptness does not separate them.
#
# The fit does not need any of that. A wrong cut fits badly and the right cut fits at
# r2_fringe = 0.990 -- so try a few and keep the one that works. It cannot be fooled by
# envelope shape, contrast rolloff, DC model error or the period estimate, because it never
# measures them.

    `trust_nsig` / `trunc_threshold` override TRUST_NSIG / TRUNC_THRESHOLD for this call
    (the app surfaces them as UI knobs). They are parameters, never mutated globals, so
    concurrent callers cannot reconfigure each other. None = use the module default, which
    is the value the harness calibrated.

    `ref_primary` is the wavelength the phase is WANTED at. None => the fitted intensity
    centroid muU, which is what the standalone and the harness use. A live caller that lets
    the operator pin a reference (the app's `lambda_ref`) must pass it here, or the answer
    silently drifts from the wavelength they asked for to wherever the envelope centred
    this frame -- a fraction of a nm, but it is THEIR lock point, not ours to move.

    `ref_policy` is an optional ReferencePolicy carried ACROSS traces by a live caller, to
    add hysteresis to the phase-reference choice. Omit it (standalone, harness) and the
    reference falls back immediately whenever the spectral centre cannot be trusted.
    The reference actually used is R["ref_wl"]; the coefficients in R["csig_at_centre"]
    are expressed at it. Callers must READ ref_wl rather than assume 802.

    `anchor` is the (U_base, D) continuum measurement from baseline_anchor() on the FULL
    frame, taken BEFORE this window was cut -- ZOOM itself contains no continuum, so the
    caller has to supply it (in the app, that means measuring it before PhaseTracker
    windows the spectrum and threading it down). Omitting it leaves the envelope offset
    unbounded, which is safe on low-visibility traces and wrong on bright ones.

    Returns a dict R with every intermediate needed for plotting and for
    ground-truth comparison. R["status"] is "ok" for a normal recovery, or one

    Fit normally first. If that explains the trace (`_explains`), return it -- this is the
    common case and costs nothing extra. Only if the fit FAILS do we scan candidate cuts,
    i.e. we spend time only on frames that would otherwise have been dropped and produced
    nothing at all.

    Why a scan rather than a detector: every detector has to MEASURE the clip, and each
    measurement is defeated by a different property of a real trace (see the TRUNCREC_*
    block). The fit needs none of them -- a wrong cut fits badly, the right one fits at
    r2_fringe = 0.990 -- so we ask the fit instead.

    We take the SMALLEST cut that explains the trace, not the best-scoring one. rms_frac
    always improves as you cut more, because you are deleting the hardest data, so a scan
    that minimised it would happily "explain" any bad frame by cutting down to three
    fringes. Stopping at the first success makes a needless cut unreachable.

    R["recovered"] says a cut was found this way, and R["trunc"]["side"]/["cut_left"]/
    ["cut_right"] carry it, so a caller cannot tell a scanned cut from a detected one and
    does not need to.
