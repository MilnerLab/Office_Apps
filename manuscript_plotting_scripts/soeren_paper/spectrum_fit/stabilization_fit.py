"""Thin adapter between the app and ``fringe_core`` — the verified fringe analysis.

**There is no math in this file, and none may be added.** ``fringe_core.py`` is a VERBATIM
COPY of the standalone ``Data/20260709/spectrometer/fringe_core.py``; this module only
translates between the app's frozen dataclasses and that module's ``analyze()``.

That rule is the whole point. Until 2026-07-16 this file carried a hand-maintained second
copy of the math, and every bug found that day was drift between the two copies:

  * ``fit_ftol=1e-4`` was passed as L-BFGS-B's *relative* ``ftol`` (its default is 2.22e-9),
    so the envelope fit quit after 19 iterations and returned offset **255** against a truth
    of **155** on the real bright trace — squeezing sigma ~12% narrow and inflating
    ``rms_frac``, i.e. feeding the accept gate that was rejecting live frames;
  * ``cubic_init = [C, 0.0, A, 0.0]`` forced the carrier ``c1 = 0``, and the soft-L1 fit
    never climbed out: measured, the port reported c1 of -0.15/-4.03/-3.02/-0.39 on the four
    real traces where the standalone reads 6.65/23.81/8.20/7.68. The carrier — the quantity
    phase stabilization locks to — was wrong on **every trace**;
  * the baseline anchor, the truncated-arm detector, BIC phase-order selection and the trust
    gate simply never arrived.

None of that was a hard bug to write; it was inevitable given two copies. ``analyze_trace``
now delegates, and ``test/fringe_parity_test.py`` asserts this module and the standalone
agree bit-for-bit on the real traces, so the copies cannot drift again in silence.

If you need to change the analysis, change the standalone ``fringe_core.py``, re-run its
harnesses (``verify_phase.py``, ``synth_test.py``, ``synth_truncation.py``), and copy the
file across whole. Do not patch this side.
